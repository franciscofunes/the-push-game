## ISSUES

1. **Lights Not Displaying After First Click:**
   - Potential issues with the initial state of the lights or rendering logic.
   - Suggested solutions:
     - Check the initial state of the lights and ensure it's set correctly based on the gameState.
     - Initialize the lights state inside the `useMemoryMode` hook with consideration to the gameState.

2. **Button Not Turning Off After User Input:**
   - Ensure that the lights state is correctly updated in the `handleUserInput` function.
   - The `turnOffLights` function should set the corresponding lights to false.
   - Check for any interference with the state.
   - If issues persist, consider managing the UI state within the child component (`PushButtonsPanel`) based on the gameState.

3. **Pattern Matching Issue:**
   - Even when reproducing the same pattern, it's reported as incorrect.
   - Suggested debugging steps:
     - Log the generated pattern and user input to the console during pattern evaluation.
     - Check for discrepancies between the generated pattern and user input.
     - Ensure that the comparison logic in `evaluateMemoryPattern` is correctly implemented.
